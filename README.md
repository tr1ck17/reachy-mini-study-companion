REACHY MINI STUDY COMPANION

This project displays a (currently) very basic adapative tutoring model using the Reachy Mini (as of right now, designed for the simulated model)

Questions asked by the bot are adjusted according to the streak of correct answers the participant has answered

The adaptive difficulty is based in this way:
  easy -> medium -> hard

Reachy has some gestures that show encouragement, agreement, or guided direction:
  Nods for correct answers
  Shakes for incorrect answers
  Wiggling Antennas for greeting and goodbyes

Incorrect questions are stored in a list and repeated at the end of the session
