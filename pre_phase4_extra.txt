Possible things to add in at this point (beyond just more complex logic):
	if question missed more than once:
		slow speech down, and add more encouragement
	if perfect scores:
		harder question list next time (multiple question lists of varying difficulty)
	if student struggling with improvement:
		the effort, or trials, will be praised, not whether correct or not
	
	
Potential to add a student profile, for adaptive logic?
	ex:
	student_profile = {
		"got_correct_answers": 0, # initial scores
		"got_incorrect_answers": 0
	}
	updates after each answer, and behavior of reachy changes accordingly:
		if student profile has more than 2 incorrect answers per question list, then add more encouragement, more personal message (e.g. You're doing good, let's go a little slower)
	Above is suggestion from AI Model: Add in adaptive decision making

Later down road maybe we can add speech-to-text, LLM for dynamic question generation, and personalized lesson plan based on student answers? Improved questioning will be needed as students get older or progress
