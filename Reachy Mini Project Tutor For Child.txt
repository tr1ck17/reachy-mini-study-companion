Reachy Mini Project: Tutor For Children (Phase 1)

1 subject to start: math
	method: flashcard-esque
3 questions only for now
script for bot: greeting->question->correct/incorrect response->encouragement
gestures for each response:
	Greeting->wave
	Correct response->nod and clap
	Incorrect Response->shake head
	Ending: arm raise / wave

State machine:
	Greeting
	Question
	Evaluate
	Feedback
	Next Question / End

run demo loop once hardcoding complete
adjust code accordingly to ensure pauses for natural gesture timing, speech clarity, and waiting for response from child

this gives our desired novelty: human-like interactions, physical bot, tutor for children = innovative idea

will go through some runs and fix any breaks in loop

need to check that gestures and speech are in sync; else unnatural

pitch: This prototype shows how an AI powered robot can improve attention and engagement by guiding repetition, giving feedback immediately, along with gestures, and encouraging participation from the participant along the way

for now, on time limit: 3 questions, 1 skill, loop

current python outline/pseudocode file:
for now, runs on sim program, will have to replace with Reachy API

# import section
from reachy_mini import Reachy
import time (for pausing, etc)

# questions section
question list:
questions = [
	{"question1": "whats this?", "answer": "this"},
	{"question2": "whats this?", "answer": "this"},
	{"question3": "whats this?", "answer": "this"},
]

# gestures
def wave():			# for greeting
	(work on code setup)

def nod():			# for correct answers
	(code later)

def shake():			# for incorrect answers
	(code later)

def clap():			# encouragement / correct answers
	(code later)

# speech functions
def speak(text):		# will take hardcoded speech input for now
	(code later, implement pausing as well, api needed too?)

# demo loop for testing
def run_demo():
	call wave function
	call speak function with greeting text

	use 'for' loop, loop through questions in list:
		call speak function on current question in list

		# wait for input (for now, keyboard?)
		define answerinput for user = input("Answer?: ")	# we can replace this with voice later I think

		if user answer == the question answer key
			call nod func
			call clap func
			call speak func with custom text, indicate moving on to next question
			ensure functions synch properly

		else question wrong:
			call shake func
			call speak func with custom, re-encouraging text, move on to next problem or try again

		call speak func, encouragement, support, and goodbye
		call wave func

# main run function
